What you watch in Jellyfin shows up on [Simkl](https://simkl.com) as you watch it: the
title appears in your "Watching now" banner the moment playback starts, pauses are
tracked, and the item is marked watched once you stop past 80%. Manual check marks,
rewatches and per-user settings are covered too. Each Jellyfin user links their own
Simkl account.

## Installation

1. In Jellyfin: **Dashboard → Plugins → Repositories → Add**, with this URL:

   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/romskidd/jellyfin-plugin-simkl-scrobbler/master/manifest.json
   ```
2. Open the **Catalog** tab, install **RK Simkl Scrobbler**, and restart Jellyfin.
3. The plugin appears in the dashboard sidebar, under the plugins section.

Requires Jellyfin 10.11.x. A free Simkl account is enough; rewatch tracking needs
Simkl Pro or VIP, as Simkl only offers it there.

## Linking a Simkl account

- **Administrators**: open the plugin page in the dashboard, pick a Jellyfin profile,
  click **Log In**, enter the code at simkl.com/pin. The page updates on its own once
  Simkl accepts the code.
- **Everyone else**: the plugin has a self-service page that any user can open
  without dashboard access. The administrator finds the link to share on the plugin
  page. If the optional [Plugin Pages](https://github.com/IAmParadox27/jellyfin-plugin-pages)
  plugin is installed, the page is also listed in the user sidebar; it is never required.

Each profile keeps its own Simkl login and settings.

## Features

**Scrobbling**
- Real-time `start` / `pause` / `stop` events, so titles appear in your live
  "Watching now" banner and paused positions follow you across Simkl-connected devices
- Marked watched when you stop past 80% (decided by Simkl, per its scrobble guide)
- Events are sent only on real player actions, never on a timer
- Items that Simkl can't match by IMDb/TMDb/TVDB ids are matched by filename

**Marking and rewatches**
- Ticking an episode, a season or a movie as played in Jellyfin adds it to your
  Simkl history in one batched request; unticking can remove it (off by default)
- **Rewatches** (Simkl Pro / VIP): finishing something you had already watched is
  filed by Simkl as a rewatch session, and later episodes of the same show join it.
  Off by default. The plugin only offers a stop as a rewatch when at least half of
  the item played in that session, so resuming near the end never counts; Simkl
  applies its own rules on top (item already watched, two days between viewings)

**Per user**
- Movies and shows on or off, minimum runtime filter
- Library exclusions, to keep home videos or kids' content off Simkl
- Watch statistics, the last scrobble with an **Open on Simkl** link, and the last
  rewatch, on both the admin page and the self-service page

**Reliability**
- A stop that Simkl doesn't confirm is queued and replayed for up to 24 hours, so a
  network blip on the final event doesn't lose an episode
- An expired or rejected Simkl login is detected at startup and reported as
  "Link expired" instead of looking connected while nothing scrobbles
- Requests follow Simkl's API guidelines: one write per second per user, settings
  and statistics re-read only when Simkl reports a change, PIN status polled at the
  interval Simkl asks for

## Upgrade notes

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Coming from 9.3.0.0 or earlier?** Since 9.4.0.0 the plugin runs as its own Simkl
> application, and Simkl tokens are bound to the application that issued them. Every
> user has to **link their Simkl account again, once**. The plugin shows "Link expired"
> with the usual PIN button; all settings are kept.

> [!NOTE]
> **Renamed in 9.5.0.0.** "Simkl Scrobbler" became **RK Simkl Scrobbler** at Simkl's
> request, to avoid confusion with Simkl's own apps and the official Jellyfin plugin.
> The plugin id is unchanged, so updates continue as before; nothing to do.

> [!WARNING]
> **Installed a version ≤ 9.0.0.4 (before 2026-08-30)?** Those builds still shared the
> official plugin's id and no longer receive updates. Uninstall the old "Simkl" plugin,
> then install RK Simkl Scrobbler from the repository above. Your Simkl login and
> settings are kept.

Don't run this plugin together with the official Simkl plugin: both would scrobble the
same playbacks twice.

## Privacy and Simkl API usage

The plugin talks only to Simkl's API, on behalf of each linked user, with that user's
own token. It sends what is needed to identify the title (IMDb/TMDb/TVDB ids, title,
year, season and episode numbers) plus playback progress. Nothing is sent to the
plugin author or anyone else. The plugin identifies itself to Simkl as
`rk-simkl-scrobbler` and was reviewed against Simkl's API guidelines with the Simkl
team's feedback.

## Troubleshooting

- **Nothing scrobbles**: check that the profile is linked, that the item's library is
  not excluded, and that the item is longer than the minimum runtime. The server log
  has one line per scrobble event under `Jellyfin.Plugin.Simkl`.
- **"Link expired"**: Simkl no longer accepts the stored token (typically after the
  9.4.0.0 update). Link again with the PIN button.
- **No rewatch recorded**: rewatches need Simkl Pro or VIP, the option must be on for
  that profile, at least half of the item must have played in that session, and Simkl
  ignores a second viewing of the same episode within two days.
- **Two scrobbles per playback**: the official Simkl plugin is installed alongside.
  Keep one of the two.

## About

This project started as a fork of the official
[jellyfin-plugin-simkl](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-plugin-simkl), which only
marks items watched after playback. Real-time scrobbling was added on top, and since
9.1.0.0 the plugin is independent, with its own plugin id, maintained by
[romskidd](https://github.com/romskidd). Thanks to the Simkl team for their API and
their review. Feedback, bug reports and ideas are welcome in the
[issues](https://github.com/romskidd/jellyfin-plugin-simkl-scrobbler/issues).

## Version history

| Version | Date | Changes |
|---|---|---|
| **9.5.0.0** | 2026-09-03 | Renamed **RK Simkl Scrobbler** at Simkl's request (unofficial plugin, not affiliated with or endorsed by Simkl or Jellyfin); plugin id unchanged. Rewatches are now filed by Simkl directly on the scrobble stop (Pro/VIP): no more watched lookup at playback start, no separate history write, same safeguards. Settings and statistics re-read only when Simkl's activity feed changes; PIN status polled at Simkl's interval. Identifies as rk-simkl-scrobbler. |
| **9.4.0.0** | 2026-09-02 | **Rewatches** (Simkl Pro / VIP) recorded as separate Simkl sessions, off by default, with safeguards (item already watched per Jellyfin or Simkl, at least half played this session). The plugin now runs as its **own Simkl application**: every user has to link their account again once (shown as "Link expired"); stale links are detected at startup. "Open on Simkl" link and last rewatch on both settings pages. Requests paced to Simkl's one-write-per-second limit. Security pass (admin endpoints require an administrator, tokens kept out of logs and console, escaped parameters). PIN flow lands on a confirmation page. |
| **9.3.0.0** | 2026-08-31 | Self-service linking: any user can connect their own Simkl account from a standalone page, no dashboard access needed (optional Plugin Pages integration adds it to the sidebar; no dependency either way). Watches Simkl doesn't confirm are queued and replayed for up to 24h. Per-user library exclusions. An expired Simkl login is now reported instead of failing silently. The plugin also appears in the dashboard sidebar and the settings page was redesigned. |
| **9.2.0.2** | 2026-08-31 | Fixes over 9.2.0.0: Simkl returns an empty body for URLs with a trailing slash + query parameters, which broke the settings page (infinite spinner) and the filename fallback — URLs are now normalized. Watch statistics use the correct endpoint (`POST /users/{id}/stats`) and the page shows your account type. The profile selector now opens on the logged-in user, so Save/Log In always target the profile shown. The page no longer blocks if a Simkl call fails. (9.2.0.1 was an unreleased intermediate build.) |
| 9.2.0.0 | 2026-08-31 | **Broken — use 9.2.0.2.** Manual "mark played" (and optional unmark) now syncs to Simkl, batched per season. Settings page shows Simkl watch stats and the last scrobble result. Every API request now identifies the app (`app-name`/`app-version`), required by Simkl since April 2026. |
| **9.1.0.0** | 2026-08-30 | New independent identity: own plugin id, name "Simkl Scrobbler" (renamed RK Simkl Scrobbler in 9.5.0.0), owner romskidd. No functional changes over 9.0.0.4. |
| **9.0.0.4** | 2026-08-30 | Fix: episodes were scrobbled with the *episode's* own provider ids (e.g. the episode IMDB id) in the `show` object, which Simkl often can't resolve. The parent series is now looked up through the Jellyfin library and its series-level IMDB/TMDB/TVDB ids are sent instead. Fixes tracking for shows whose episodes carry their own IMDB ids (e.g. Euphoria US, For All Mankind) and avoids the flaky filename-search fallback. |
| **9.0.0.3** | 2026-06-01 | Pin `Jellyfin.Controller` to exactly 10.11.8 so the plugin loads on all Jellyfin 10.11.x servers. First stable release of the log-spam fix below. |
| 9.0.0.2 | *(never released)* | Same as 9.0.0.1 but accidentally built against Jellyfin.Controller 10.11.10 — failed to load on older 10.11.x servers. Superseded by 9.0.0.3. |
| 9.0.0.1 | *(tag only)* | Fix: stop the per-second "user not logged in" log spam. Sessions that can't be scrobbled are evaluated once and then skipped silently. |
| **9.0.0.0** | 2026-05-22 | First fork release: real-time scrobbling (`start`/`pause`/`stop` lifecycle, "Watching now" banner, server-side watched-marking at 80%), settings toggles, filename fallback. |
| ≤ 8.0.0.0 | — | Upstream history: see the [official plugin releases](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-plugin-simkl/releases). |
